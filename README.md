<br>

### Want live Spotify data?

1. Create a [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create a new app
2. Get your Client ID and Client Secret from the app dashboard
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   New-Item -Path .env -ItemType File
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   touch .env
   ```
4. Add your credentials to `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```
5. Start with the backend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors with Spotify API**
- **Problem:** API requests fail due to CORS restrictions

- **Details:** Spotify Web API cannot be called directly from browsers due to CORS policy

**Missing Environment Variables**
- **Problem:** App shows "No music data available" or API errors
- **Solution:** Check that `.env` file exists with valid Spotify credentials
- **Reference:** Follow the "Want live Spotify data?" section above for setup guidance

**Port Conflicts**
- **Frontend (Port 5173):** Check if another Vite/dev server is running
- **Backend (Port 3001):** Check if another Express server is using the port
- **Solution:** Kill existing processes or modify port configuration

**Build/TypeScript Errors**
- **Problem:** TypeScript compilation errors during build
- **Solution:** Run `npm run build` to see specific error details
- **Common fix:** Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
